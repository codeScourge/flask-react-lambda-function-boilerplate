# flask-react-boilerplate

### motivation
Serverside-rendering is cool, but I like Python for backend.

### features
This boilerplate features a simple flask app which renders an HTML page. Then ReactJS can be used to build this Single-Page-Application. React Router is also setup for Client Site Routing.


### setup
- install serverless cli
- ```npm install```
- ```npm run build```

### how to deploy to AWS
This boilerplate is designed to be hosted on AWS lambda and can be deployed using the serverless Framework (see serverless.yml) by calling ```bash deploy.sh```
